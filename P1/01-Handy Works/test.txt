In my opinion, using a land for purpose of developing the city is more important. In light of Kelly and Claireâ€™s statement, I want to add that building according to the need of industry will help people in many ways. For example, shopping centers provide a range of benefits for people, such as creating job opportunities and contributing to the local economy. Another example is a manufacturing plant, which is essential for the production of goods. It also creates jobs, simulates economic growth, and contributes to the development of new technologies. To sum up, although green spaces offers sustainable benefits to cities, I believe that we need to prioritize meeting the needs of the population and be careful about the potential impact on the environment through careful planning.
