## Project Overview  
This project aims to uncover the hidden impact of rainy weather on the **Level of Service (LOS)** in transportation systems using **machine learning**. By analyzing data and implementing neural networks, the project strives to provide insights into traffic behavior under adverse weather conditions.  

🌧️ "As raindrops dance on the pavement and traffic jams emerge, this journey explores how every drop and delay teaches us the art of data-driven discovery."

## Project Steps  
1. **Download the UTD19 dataset** from [this link](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/437802).  
2. **Prepare the data** for training with a Neural Network.  
3. Extract data and build the prediction model.
