## Project Overview  
Inspired by the **"PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp 2023-6"** on Udemy (52 hours and 14 minutes of learning), this project dives into creating a neural network model. The goal is to identify and analyze dishes captured in images, unraveling the mysteries of culinary delights through pixels.

## Project Steps  
1. **Download the Food101 Dataset** from [this link](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.Food101.html).  
2. **Prepare the data** with transformations and augmentations.  
3. Apply **transfer learning** using the [EfficientNetB2 model](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.efficientnet_b2.html).  
4. **Train the model** and deploy it on **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)**.
