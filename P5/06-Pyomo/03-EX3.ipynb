    "1. **Multi-dimensional decision variables** - The 4D variable `x[i,j,k,m]` represents complex production scenarios\n",

    "2. **Capacity constraints with efficiency factors** - Real-world production isn't 100% efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple constraint types:**\n",
    "   - Individual line capacities\n",
    "   - Aggregate capacity limits\n",
    "   - Demand/market limits\n",
    "   - Product mix requirements\n",
    "   - Transportation balance\n",

    "4. **Complex objective function** - Balancing revenue from multiple products against various cost types\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Trade-offs** - The solver finds the optimal balance between:\n",
    "   - High-revenue products vs. production costs\n",
    "   - Transportation costs vs. production distribution\n",
    "   - Capacity utilization vs. efficiency losses\n",

    "- Add inventory costs\n",
    "- Include setup costs for switching between products\n",
    "- Add time periods (multi-period planning)\n",
    "- Include uncertainty in demand or prices\n",
    "- Add quality constraints\n",
    "- Model economies of scale"
