    "\n",
    "**Chunking**: OOP allows for the grouping of related variables and functions into objects or classes, facilitating mental \"chunking\" of functionalities. This makes it easier to understand and remember code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contextual Cues**: Classes and objects serve as contextual markers, helping programmers quickly understand the role and usage of a given set of methods and variables within the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simplifies Complexity**: OOP encourages the breakdown of complex problems into smaller, more manageable objects or modules. This modular approach simplifies complexity and aids understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduction in Cognitive Load**: By encapsulating details and exposing only necessary interfaces, OOP minimizes the amount of information that developers need to hold in their working memory at one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mental Models**: The use of classes and objects allows for a more natural mapping to real-world entities and their behaviors, fitting well with human mental models and making the code easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequential Learning**: OOP's modular nature allows for a step-by-step learning process. Developers can understand one class or object at a time, progressively building up their understanding of the entire system."
