## Project Overview  

This project explores a comparative analysis between the **Gravity Model (GM)** and advanced techniques like **Neural Networks (NN)** and **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** for predicting transportation flows.  

Using real-world datasets from **Siouxfall**, **Anaheim**, and **Chicago**, the goal is to evaluate the strengths and limitations of each method. The project involves discovering patterns, drawing bold conclusions, and challenging conventional understanding of urban dynamics.  

ðŸŒ† "Through these datasets, weâ€™re not just crunching numbers â€“ weâ€™re revealing the mysteries of urban life with exciting insights!"
