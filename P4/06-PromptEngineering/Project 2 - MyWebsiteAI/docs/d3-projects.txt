## [Simplex-step 🧑‍💻🎯📥](https://keivanjamali.com/keivan-jamali-project-portfolio/simplex-method-python-library-keivan-jamali/)

**Project Overview:**  
For my Systems Engineering course project, I built a Python library that implements the Simplex method, designed to solve optimization problems step-by-step. The library aims to make the process as transparent and user-friendly as possible.

## [Food Vision 🍕👁️💪](https://keivanjamali.com/keivan-jamali-project-portfolio/culinary-image-recognition-deep-learning/)

**Project Overview:**  
Embarking on a culinary odyssey, I sought to teach a machine to decode the secrets of gastronomy through images. Based on the "Udemy – PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp 2023-6" course, I crafted a neural network to recognize food images, blending technology with taste. #DeepLearning #NeuralNetworks
