Throughout my coursework, I have undertaken various projects that have enriched my programming skills and knowledge. One notable project involved developing a Windows program using Python to calculate variance, showcasing my ability to apply programming concepts to practical problems. Despite the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I dedicated this period to extensively train in Python programming through a variety of online courses, further honing my programming abilities.
In addition to coursework projects, I actively participated in an environmental project centered around simulating pollution in the Persian Gulf. Within this project, I introduced an innovative simulation technique, demonstrating my capacity for creative problem-solving. Moreover, I successfully simulated the Azadi Tower, a prominent landmark in our country, as part of the "computer application in civil engineering" course. These projects collectively underscore my strong programming background and proficiency.
Currently, I am deeply engaged in two research projects, under the guidance of Dr. Amini, an esteemed scholar who holds a BC, MS, and PhD from Berkeley University. The first research project involves leveraging the potential of deep learning in transportation to simulate and predict flow in large networks. This undertaking showcases my aptitude for combining cutting-edge techniques with transportation domain knowledge. In the second research project, I explore the integration of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and machine learning, with a specific focus on environmental factors. This project demonstrates my ability to bridge multiple disciplines to tackle complex challenges.
In preparation for these research projects, I completed a state-of-the-art course on PyTorch titled "PyTorch for Deep Learning in 2023 Zero to Mastery" on Udemy. This comprehensive course concentrated on vision-related tasks, enabling me to gain hands-on experience in modeling vision models using PyTorch. The knowledge and skills acquired through this course have provided me with a solid foundation to contribute effectively to the research projects.
Collectively, these diverse experiences and projects highlight my strong programming background and my commitment to expanding my skills and knowledge in the field of traffic engineering and deep learning. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my expertise to make meaningful contributions to the research projects and advance the field of traffic engineering.
