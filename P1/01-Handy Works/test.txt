Dear Admissions Committee,
I am writing to express my strong interest in pursuing my graduate studies in transportation engineering at University of California – Davis (UCD). As a successful undergraduate student of civil engineering at Sharif University of Technology, Iran's prestigious institution, I am confident that I possess the necessary qualifications to successfully undertake a Ph.D. in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UCD.
From an early age, I became familiar with the realms of mathematics and construction, thanks to the guidance of my grandfather, a prosperous civil engineer. This profound intuition served as a compass, leading me to discover my aspirations when I was a teenager and encouraging me to prepare for their realization. My high school education took place within the National Organization for the Development of Exceptional Talents (Sampad), an environment that fostered my growth amidst the brightest minds in the city.
As I engaged in extracurricular activities such as training for chess, ping-pong and playing the piano, I simultaneously dedicated myself to preparing for the university entrance exam. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I exceled, securing a position among the top 0.2% out of 155,000 participants. This success led me to Sharif University of Technology where I pursued civil engineering in the esteemed department. With a GPA of 18.84 out of 20 (4.0/4.0), I ranked 2nd among 79 peers, demonstrating my continuous dedication to excellence.
My inherent passion for programming propelled me to embark on a journey with Python right from the onset of my undergraduate studies. During the initial three semesters, which were conducted online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I utilized this time to augment my programming skills. I delved into various platforms such as Coursera, Euler and Faradars, seeking experiences and enhancing my skills in Python programming. Concurrently, I consistently achieved the highest scores in my university courses, excelling in my academic pursuits. My remarkable successes and programming skills captivate me with the idea of delving into the realm of transportation for my master's and Ph.D. studies.
This fascination gained further momentum when I enrolled in the "Traffic Engineering" course, where I gained a comprehensive understanding of this field. I secured an impressive score of 18.3 out of 20 in the course, establishing myself as the top student in the class. To deepen my conviction in this domain, I explored other courses that involved projects. First, the "Computer Applications in Civil Engineering" course-project aimed to provide a comprehensive simulation using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to find displacements and forces resulting from external forces. Second, the "Environmental Engineering" course-project focused on large-scale data, aiming to simulate diffusion and advection in the Persian Gulf through programming. Both these projects had an emphasized on numerical methods and programming skills. I Consistently achieving top marks and received recognition for my innovative approaches, including the implementation of optimized code. After these experiences, I became more certain that transportation engineering was the path I was destined to pursue.
Furthermore, I conducted a research paper under the supervision of Dr. Amini, focusing on predicting flow in large-scale networks and comparing the accuracy of the Gravity model, Neural Network, and Graph Neural Network. This research allowed me to delve into advanced skills in machine learning and optimization, data analysis and technical writing. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into the complexities of traffic demand modeling. Currently, I eagerly await the publication of our research paper, which showcases our findings and contributions in this area.
To further enrich my knowledge, I enrolled in the "Intelligent Transportation Systems" course, specifically designed for graduate students with a research project about the impact of rainfall on the Level of Service. Additionally, I pursued the "Advanced Programming" course to enhance my programming skills. Moreover, in my quest for deeper insights into machine learning, I voluntarily undertook the task of reviewing the book "A Primer on Machine Learning Applications in Civil Engineering" by Paresh Chandra Deka, under the supervision of Prof. Ahmadi. This endeavor aimed to identify and address conceptual issues in the translated version of the book, allowing me to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
In addition to all my projects and research, I have also had the opportunity to serve as a teaching assistant (TA) for two courses, which won’t normally be accepted to the undergraduate students unless to some excellent students: "Statistics and Probabilities in Civil Engineering" and "Analysis of Structures I." As a TA, I had the opportunity to express myself effectively in the class, build communications, and enhance my presentation and public speaking skills. This role allowed me to reinforce my understanding of the subject matter. Moreover, I had the opportunity to conducted a virtual introduction to Python programming class for first‑year students at the Sharif University of Technology. I received overwhelmingly positive feedback from the class, with a rating of 4.8 out of 5 from more than 100 attendees.
In conclusion, I am thrilled about the opportunity to pursue my graduate studies in transportation engineering at University of California - Davis. My goal and plan after graduation are to continue as a researcher and contribute to significant projects worldwide. The alignment of my personal goals with the research interests of your faculty, along with my demonstrated leadership skills and unique background, make me a strong candidate for your program. I am confident that my passion for research, commitment to excellence, and eagerness to contribute to the field will allow me to thrive as a graduate student at University of California - Davis. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Keivan Jamali
