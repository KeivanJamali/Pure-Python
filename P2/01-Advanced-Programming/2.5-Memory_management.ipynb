    "Mutability is closely related to how objects are stored in stack and heap memory in Python. When a mutable object like a list or dictionary is created, it is stored in the heap memory. A reference to this object, typically a local variable in a function, is stored in the stack. Because the object is mutable, any changes made to it through one reference are reflected in all other references to the same object, regardless of where those references existâ€”in the stack or globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable objects, on the other hand, cannot be changed once created. When an operation is performed on an immutable object, a new object is created in the heap, and the stack reference is updated to point to this new object, if assigned. This is why immutable objects effectively behave as if they are being passed \"by value\" in function calls."
