    "    **Identify Nouns**: Read through the requirements and identify the nouns or noun phrases. These often correspond to potential classes.</br>\n",
    "    **Identify Relationships**: Look for relationships between the nouns (e.g., \"has-a,\" \"is-a\"). This can help in defining **class hierarchies** and **compositions**.</br>\n",
    "    **Identify Behaviors**: Identify verbs or actions associated with each noun. **These often become methods within your classes**.</br>\n",
    "    **Group Common Features**: If you notice that multiple classes would have similar attributes or methods, consider creating a base class.</br>\n",
    "    **Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensure that each class has a single, well-defined responsibility. If a class seems to be handling too many tasks, it might need to be split.</br>\n"
