## 2. ITS Technologies

Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), Intelligent traffic lights (ITL), Virtual Traffic Lights (VTL), and Mobility Prediction are essential systems that fall below the umbrella of Intelligent Transportation Systems. They are the primary devices employed to complete the smart city revolution. ITS is crucial for realizing smart cities since it helps minimize vehicle idle time, prioritizes emergency vehicles, shortens emergency response time, improves traffic efficiency, prevents unexpected collisions, and reduces carbon emissions. Integrating 5G real-time communications within these technologies can further boost their efficacy.

It has been demonstrated via research that ITS-based effective traffic management systems have the potential to drastically cut travel times by as much as 25%, resulting in significant time savings for commuters. Through the optimization of the timing of traffic lights, intelligent traffic management systems have the potential to reduce energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases by around 15–20%. According to the findings of a survey that was carried out in urban areas, intelligent traffic management systems can reduce the number of accidents that occur in metropolitan areas by as much as 20%. This is accomplished by improving the coordination of traffic flow and the management of incidents in real-time.

### 2.1. Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs)

Adopting Internet of Vehicle (IoV) ecosystem for smart cities will enable the collection and sharing of information about cars, roads, infrastructure, buildings, and more. The VANETs field is vast in that it is divided into various subcategories describing how the process of VANETs performs in Smart Cities.

**Types of VANETs:**

- **Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V):** Vehicles communicate with each other directly to exchange information such as location, speed, and direction. This data is essential for developing cooperative safety apps to help avoid accidents and minimize traffic congestion.

- **Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I):** Enables vehicles to communicate with traffic lights, sensors, and cameras to enhance safety and traffic flow. These types of communication can provide drivers with real-time information about road conditions, traffic congestion, and accidents.

- **Vehicle-to-Server (V2S):** A subset of V2I that involves communication between a vehicle and a remote server and is commonly used for real-time traffic monitoring and route optimization.

- **Vehicle-to-House (V2H):** Connects cars with home equipment, including charging stations and intelligent appliances. It can also charge electric vehicles, warm or chill them, and operate home automation tasks like turning on lights or opening the front doors.

- **Vehicle-to-Cloud (V2C):** Establishes a connection between the vehicle and cloud-based services by exchanging data collected from the vehicle's sensors, navigation and other smart equipment about car status, road condition sent to the cloud for analysis and then sent back to the vehicle in the form of valuable accurate time information as traffic condition and personalized route planning.

- **Vehicle-to-Network (V2N):** Used to connect the vehicle with the external network as a cellular network to access the features of the cloud-based services and connect with intelligent traffic lights and traffic management systems; it is also used to receive real-time updates about traffic, navigation, and weather conditions.

- **Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P):** Proves highly advantageous at intersections. Real-time warning messages are transmitted to both pedestrians' smartphones and vehicle screens via a cellular network. This communication system operates effectively when a vehicle approaches an intersection or crossroad, and a pedestrian unexpectedly appears on the road without noticing the approaching vehicle traveling at high speed.

- **V2X:** Combines all the essential types of VANETs (V2V, V2I, V2P and V2N) to work together to make the vehicle connect easily with everything around it.

### 2.2. Intelligent Traffic Lights (ITL)

ITLs are crucial to ITS because they manage traffic movement and increase road safety. ITLs are traffic lights that improve traffic movement and lessen congestion using real-time traffic data and sophisticated algorithms. They gather real-time traffic data using various equipment including cameras, radars and sensors. Advanced algorithms are then used to analyze the collected data, determining the ideal scheduling for traffic lights based on variables like traffic volume, congestion, and pedestrian movement. This is contrary to conventional traffic lights, which are only set to change color phases after a predetermined time.

For instance, ITLs can adjust the timing of traffic lights to ease congestion in heavy traffic. This leads to decreased idling time and reduced CO2 emissions from vehicles. ITLs can also identify bicycles and walkers and give them secure crossing periods, lowering the rate of accidents.

Additionally, ITL can control the traffic in such a way as to enable emergency vehicles to pass without being delayed. It detects emergency vehicles and changes their condition to green, thus allowing them to pass swiftly. ITLs could also lessen the collisions brought on by dodging red lights. ITLs can decrease the time that vehicles must wait at red lights by optimizing the timing of traffic signs using cutting-edge algorithms. This reduces the desire to jump red lights, which may eventually result in fewer accidents.

The procedure will vastly improve with employing 5G and IoT. Because 5G networks have minimal latency, traffic signals can communicate with each other and with other linked devices in real-time. This enables traffic lights to react to changes in traffic patterns more rapidly and modify their signals appropriately.

Sensors placed on the road surface can identify the existence of cars. To determine the existence and movement of vehicles, these devices can employ various technologies such as inductive loops, radar, or infrared. Cameras can also be placed to record pictures of the junction and evaluate them using computer vision algorithms. These algorithms can recognize the existence of vehicles, distinguish their class (e.g., automobile, truck, bicycle, emergency vehicle), and monitor their movement. IoT devices, such as GPS-enabled automobiles or cell phones, can also provide information on the position and movement of vehicles near the junction.

### 2.3. Virtual Traffic Lights (VTL)

The invention of the VTLs has dramatically improved the ITS with the help of 5G and Road infrastructure (cameras, sensors, etc.) to detect vehicles and project virtual signals onto the road, which OBUs detect in equipped vehicles to inform drivers about road conditions.

For example, when there is a car moving straight in the intersection, and there is another car coming from the left or right at a higher speed, the VTL detects this situation and sends a stop warning message in real time to the OBU implemented inside the vehicle; if the slower vehicle fails to stop, the VTL system can alert the driver through OBU or directly to the vehicle's automated systems, triggering an automatic braking system to prevent a collision, the same thing also happens for pedestrians crossing the street in an intersection.

VTL can also prioritize emergency vehicles, reducing emergency response times. Furthermore, using VTL in intersections can reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, increase safety, and minimize idling time at intersections. VTL is a fantastic tool for enhancing driving safety, especially at road junctions in residential areas with no actual traffic lights because of the constrained width of the streets.

OBUs are critical to the success of VTLs. They are devices installed in the car that communicate with other vehicles using the same technology to provide data about traffic conditions, speed, and additional relevant information, assisting drivers in making the right choice. Vehicles and virtual traffic signals can communicate in real time thanks to 5G technology's high-speed, low-latency connection.

### 2.4. Mobility Prediction

Mobility prediction plays a crucial role in developing smart cities and VANETs. It has received considerable attention since it can speed up the development of autonomous vehicles, improve traffic management, and increase safety while advancing the development of smart cities. The progress of this technology, which will make our roads safer and more user-friendly, will have a tremendous impact on the future of transportation.

The critical objective of mobility prediction techniques is to predict vehicle movement patterns inside a network. Various algorithms and data sources are used to predict future vehicle placements and behavior on the road. This forecast is supported by previous information, the current flow of traffic, and real-time sensor data from moving cars and the roadside.

**Applications of Mobility Prediction:**

- **Traffic Management:** Can help reduce traffic congestion by allowing intelligent traffic management systems to anticipate and proactively respond to traffic bottlenecks in real time.

- **Traffic Light Synchronization:** Can aid in optimizing traffic light synchronization. When the system knows that a group of vehicles is approaching an intersection, it can adjust the timing of traffic lights to ensure smoother traffic flow.

- **Dynamic Lane Assignment:** Can enable dynamic lane assignment on highways. If a system anticipates a high volume of traffic entering a particular lane, it can redirect vehicles to less congested lanes.

- **Safety:** Predicting the behavior of vehicles can help prevent accidents. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can use mobility prediction to alert drivers to potential collision risks.

- **Autonomous Vehicles (AVs):** Crucial for developing and deploying Autonomous Vehicles. Self-driving cars rely heavily on predicting the movements of other vehicles and pedestrians to make safe driving decisions.

- **Emergency Services:** Can assist emergency services in responding more effectively to accidents and emergencies.

- **Handover Process:** Can contribute to improving the handover process in mobile networks, reducing the number of handovers, decreasing connection and call drop rates, minimizing handover latency and improving network performance.

- **Resource Allocation:** If a network anticipates a high concentration of users in a particular area, it can allocate additional bandwidth and computing resources to ensure smooth data delivery.

- **Content Caching and Prefetching:** Allows networks to cache and pre-fetch content more intelligently by predicting which content a user is likely to request based on their location and historical behavior.

#### 2.4.1. Mobility Prediction Techniques

**1. Statistical Models:**
- Time Series Analysis: Analyzing historical data to identify patterns or trends in mobility using techniques like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.
- Regression Analysis: Establishing relationships between mobility variables and predictor variables, such as time, weather conditions, or economic factors.

**2. Machine Learning:**
- **Supervised Learning:** Algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting can predict mobility based on labeled data and classification of spatial trajectories.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Can help identify groups of similar mobility patterns or hotspots.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Useful for sequential data, making them suitable for predicting mobility over time. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a popular choice.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Can be used for predicting mobility in spatial contexts, such as object detection and tracking in images or video data.

**3. Time-Geography and Space Syntax:**
Mapping geographical data to mobility parameters such as time, speed, acceleration and direction of movement can be used to identify both temporal and spatial aspects of mobility. Geographic Information System (GIS) tools can be used to analyze and predict mobility patterns based on geographic data.

**4. Cellular Data and GPS Tracking:**
Mobile phones and GPS devices generate large amounts of location data. Analyzing this data can provide real-time insights into mobility patterns and allow for predictive modeling.

**5. Hybrid Models:**
Combining multiple methods and data sources can often lead to more accurate predictions.

- **IEEE 802.22:** Enables long-distance communication between devices and operates in the TV white space frequency range (54–862 MHz) for rural and isolated locations.

### 3.2. Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X)

C-V2X is a cellular protocol that enables the communication between vehicles and infrastructure over current cellular networks. The coverage area of C-V2X can extend beyond that of DSRC and operates in the licensed cellular spectrum.

C-V2X includes:
- **Vehicle-to-Network communication (V2N)**

## 4. Security Challenges in ITS

According to research into ITS, VANET technology and IoT equipment are becoming more vulnerable to security breaches. Securing ITS against ever-changing Cyber Threats is crucial to guaranteeing the dependability and safety of transportation systems.

### 4.1. Sybil Attacks

VANETs face substantial difficulties due to attacks on authenticity, such as Sybil attacks. The goal of a Sybil assault is to manipulate trust and even impair the network's operation by tricking genuine nodes into believing a series of falsehoods. Attackers can generate false information on traffic conditions or road dangers by taking advantage of the dispersed nature of VANETs, which can cause traffic jams or accidents. Current methods frequently fail to distinguish between real and false identities, making it difficult to detect Sybil assaults owing to technological constraints.

### 4.2. Wireless Communication Vulnerabilities

Wireless communication technologies are becoming increasingly common in ITS, which opens the door to new security risks. Flexible and broad communication between ITS components is enabled by technologies like DSRC/WAVE, Cellular-V2X, Bluetooth, and GNSS. However, these same technologies also allow attackers ways to get remote access. An attacker might remotely compromise the whole vehicular network by exploiting weaknesses in various wireless technologies.

### 4.3. Software Vulnerabilities

ITS security has major threats from software flaws in linked vehicle systems. Due to the heavy reliance on software in modern automobiles, they are susceptible to cyber attacks due to vulnerabilities such as injection holes and buffer overflows. Vulnerabilities in automotive systems can be used by attackers to introduce malicious code, which can then manipulate or access essential components without authorization.

### 4.4. Software Security Estimation

## 7. Future Work

ITS will play a pivotal role in advancing sustainable smart cities, focusing on enhancing mobility, reducing congestion, minimizing emissions, and improving overall quality of life. Several trends are anticipated to shape the future evolution of ITS:

### Emerging Technologies Integration
Future ITS will heavily integrate emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, Internet of Things, and 5G connectivity. These advancements will facilitate real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making, enabling more efficient traffic management, dynamic routing, and predictive maintenance of transportation infrastructure.

### Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
The widespread adoption of AVs is poised to revolutionize urban transportation. ITS will need to adapt by implementing infrastructure upgrades like smart traffic lights, dedicated AV lanes, and communication systems enabling vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interaction. AVs offer promises of enhanced safety, reduced congestion, and optimized energy consumption.

### Big Data and Analytics
The abundance of data generated by IoT sensors, GPS devices, traffic cameras, and mobile apps will be leveraged for insights into traffic patterns, commuter behavior, and infrastructure performance. Advanced analytics and AI algorithms will empower cities to optimize transportation networks in real-time, respond more effectively to incidents, and strategically plan future infrastructure investments.

### Dynamic Traffic Management
VANETs will enable dynamic traffic management systems that respond to real-time traffic conditions. Vehicles will receive route recommendations based on current traffic flow, road conditions, and individual preferences, thereby distributing traffic evenly, reducing travel times, and minimizing emissions.

### Advanced Safety Applications
VANETs will support advanced safety applications such as collision avoidance systems, blind spot detection, and intersection assistance. By exchanging real-time information about speed, position, and intentions, vehicles can anticipate potential collisions and take preventive actions, significantly reducing accident risks.

### Traffic Flow Optimization
VANET-based ITS can optimize traffic flow at intersections, merge points, and highway ramps by analyzing data collected from vehicles and infrastructure. Adaptive traffic signal control systems will adjust signal timings in real-time, prioritizing congested routes, reducing delays, and improving overall traffic efficiency.

### Mobile Phones as Data Collection Tools
Mobile phones equipped with sensors and cameras are expected to serve as inexpensive tools for collecting driving data and connecting vehicles within VANETs and ITS ecosystems.

### Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC)
MEC over 5G networks is emerging as a better alternative to cloud systems, bringing computing power and storage resources to the edge of the mobile network. MEC has shown fewer delays than cloud systems, enabling real-time decisions and enhancing driver safety.

### Driver Drowsiness Detection
Integration of Driver Drowsiness Detection systems within ITS ensures driver and passenger safety by detecting drowsiness and alerting nearby vehicles. In Internet of Vehicle networks, vital signals from vehicles are transmitted wirelessly to a traffic management platform, which can trigger alerts to the driver, activate autopilot for safe parking, or warn neighboring vehicles about the drowsy driver.
