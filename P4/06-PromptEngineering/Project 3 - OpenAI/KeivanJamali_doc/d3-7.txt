## Project Overview

In this project we want to model an imaginary situation in a Persian Gulf which is covering the leakage position in the ocean.

Problem:

What is the speed and the time of the pollution in these situations?

1\. only diffusion

2\. diffusion and advection with constant speed

3\. diffusion and advection with accelerating speed

## Project Steps :

- Code out the diffusion and advection.
- Find millions of colors to better showing the change in the ocean.
- Plot the figure and make the animation for better understanding the situation.

## Results of The Project

Even the low amount of leakage can be so harmful.

There are 3 results in animation and the third scenario is showing below.

## Code Sources :

This modeling is done by python.

Here you can fine all codes and results :
