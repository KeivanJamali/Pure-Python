## Project Overview

For my Systems Engineering course project, I dived into building a Python library that harnesses the power of the Simplex method. Itâ€™s all about solving problems step-by-step and making the process as transparent as possible! ðŸ˜Š

## Project Steps :

1. Performing the Simplex algorithm â€“ the magic starts here!
2. Prepping the two-phase Simplex method â€“ making sure weâ€™re ready for anything.
3. Implementing sensitivity analysis â€“ because knowing how changes affect our solutions is key.
4. Using duality to optimize the performance â€“ duality is like finding the secret sauce for efficiency!

## Results of The Project

Guess what? You can install this library in a snap! Just pop open your CMD (after youâ€™ve got Python set up) and type

`pip install Simplextep` \| Easy peasy!
