# KEIVAN JAMALI'S BACKGROUND <website>https://keivanjamali.com/keivan-jamali-civil-engineering/</website>\n
- This is his about page in his website\n
<about>Hey there! I‚Äôm Keivan Jamali, hailing from the timeless city of Yazd, Iran. Yazd‚Äôs ancient vibes are my roots, and right now, I‚Äôm diving deep into the world of Civil Engineering at Sharif University ‚Äì yep, the top-notch place for engineering in Iran. I‚Äôve got this thing for programming too, especially machine learning. I‚Äôm no Python wizard (yet!), but I get by, and I‚Äôve dabbled in HTML and CSS for some design fun. This website? One of my brainchildren, crafted with a bit of WordPress magic.\n
Civil Engineering isn‚Äôt just a career for me; it‚Äôs a love affair. Researching in this field feels like a thrilling hobby. I‚Äôm always hungry for new knowledge and love figuring out how to solve real-world problems with it. Teamwork? Sign me up! I thrive when collaborating with others, striving towards shared dreams and goals.\n
When I‚Äôm not buried in books or coding away, you‚Äôll find me in the kitchen, whipping up new recipes. Cooking is my creative playground. Music, too, has a special place in my heart. I tinker with the piano and flute ‚Äì still an amateur, but it‚Äôs all about the joy it brings. üé∂</about>\n
