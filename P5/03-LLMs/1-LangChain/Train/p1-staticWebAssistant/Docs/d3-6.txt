## Project Overview  

In this project, we aimed to model the **Azadi Tower** as a truss **2D model** using **Finite Element Analysis** (FEA). The goal was to calculate the forces and displacements at each node of the structure using this method.  

**Problem Definition:**

## Project Steps  

1. **Defining the Structure in Python:**  
   - Created a 2D truss model of the Azadi Tower.  

2. **Implementing the Finite Element Method (FEM):**  
   - Developed the algorithm to calculate forces and displacements at each node using FEA.  

3. **Plotting Results:**  
   - Visualized the displacements and forces to analyze the structural behavior.

## Results of the Project  

- The output includes the displacements and forces at each node of the structure.  
- The code can be adapted to model different structures in a truss form.  

**Project Visualization:**  
*Note: The results have been exaggerated to better illustrate the deformation pattern.*
