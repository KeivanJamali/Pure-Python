## Project Overview

As I delved into the realms of deep learning through the ‚ÄúPyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp 2023-6‚Äù course by Udemy for 52 hours and 14 minutes, tends in aa amazing model. What if a model could decipher the mysteries behind our culinary delights with just a glance at a picture? üçîüì∏¬†Thus, my journey began, crafting a neural network to discern the essence of every dish captured through the lens. Join me to see the flavors hidden within pixels.

## Project Steps :

1. Downloading the Food101 Dataset from the provided [**link**.](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.Food101.html)
2. Prepare the data, ensuring that transformers and augmentations are ready.
3. Utilize transfer learning techniques to prepare the model of [**EfficientNetB2**](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.efficientnet_b2.html).
4. Train the model and deploy it into **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)** using the provided link.
