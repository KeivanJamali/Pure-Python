# Pure-Python Repository

Welcome to the **Pure-Python** repository! This is a personal collection of Python scripts, problem solutions, and learning exercises accumulated over the course of my Python journey.

## üìö About This Repository
- **Purpose:** A learning ground and archive for hundreds of Python problems, ranging from beginner to advanced topics.
- **Content:**
  - Algorithmic challenges
  - Math and logic puzzles
  - Small utilities and scripts
  - Class notes and course exercises
  - Explorations in data structures, games, and more
- **Structure:**
  - Organized by topic, course, or project in folders like `P0`, `P1`, ..., `P5`, and `Usefull_Kit`.
  - Each folder contains scripts, notebooks, or subfolders for specific themes or classes.

## üóÇÔ∏è Example Directory Structure
| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `P0/`  | Training, basic programming, games, Euler problems, and more |
| `P1/`  | Handy works, civil engineering, advanced Python, and projects |
| `P2/`  | Advanced programming, economics, plotting, and more |
| `P3/`  | Web and server projects |
| `P4/`  | Transportation, operations research, databases, and toolkits |
| `P5/`  | MCP servers, Python class examples, deep learning, and startups |
| `Usefull_Kit/` | Reusable Python utility scripts |

## üöÄ How to Use
- Browse folders for scripts and notebooks on various topics.
