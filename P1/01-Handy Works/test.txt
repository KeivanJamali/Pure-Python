Glasses are so populare to human beings and are used in variety fields. There is a problem that cauesed by these glasses. Flying birds will not distinguish glasses from air and will collide with it. According to the author, we can solve this problem with one_way Glass, Colorful Designs and Magnetic Fields. But the professor oppose all these three suggestion.

First, One_way glass is like mirror for people or birds outside, and the professor believe that mirroring is bad too. For instance, when the glass mirror the sky or tree, birds don't undrestand it is only the reflect of light which make this sky or tree and will fly thtough it and will be harmed. There for, the first claim of the author will be failed and this metod will help birds to distinguish the glass and prevent them from flying through it.

Second method, Colorful Designs, is a method which painting on glass will help birds see the glass and prevent birds hitting the glass. On the other hand, Professor claim that although some parts re painted but it should be some parts to be clear for the building to let the people inside see out and light comes into building. Those parts can not be too small Because of its purpose. All benn said explain the reason that birds will fly through this unpainted parts and still will be harmed.

Last method, provided by author, is to build a magnetic signals to guiding birds away from the glass. This method is according to the ability to sense Earth's magnetic fields. This ability works like compass which people use to find north, south, east or west. There for birds collect the signal from biulding and change their way away from biuling. But the professor claimed that this is not usefull because birds use their ability only for long distances. For examlple, when they are migrating from cold place to a cold one, the use this compass-like method to find their way, but for short ways they use their eyes. This results in the fact that for short distance magnetic field wil not work.
