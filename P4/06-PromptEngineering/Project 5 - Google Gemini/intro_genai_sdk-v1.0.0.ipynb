That's why I'm a huge advocate for meal prepping, and today I'm sharing my go-to recipe: Teriyaki Chicken Bowls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at that gorgeousness! (See picture above).  These are SO easy to throw together on a Sunday afternoon, and they're packed with flavor and nutrients.  Here's the breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fluffy Rice:**  The perfect base for soaking up all that delicious teriyaki sauce. Use a long-grain rice that has good separation, and rinse before cooking.\n",
      "*   **Tender Teriyaki Chicken:**  Marinated in a homemade teriyaki sauce (low-sodium soy sauce, honey, ginger, garlic – you know the drill!), the chicken is cooked to perfection and sprinkled with sesame seeds and green onions.\n",
      "*   **Colorful Veggies:**  Steamed broccoli and sliced bell peppers (any color you like, though red and orange look extra vibrant) add a boost of vitamins and fiber. A quick flash in a pan with a bit of sesame oil keeps them crisp-tender.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why I Love This Recipe:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Healthy & Balanced:**  It's got protein, complex carbs, and plenty of vegetables.\n",
      "*   **Customizable:**  Swap the chicken for tofu, add different veggies, or use brown rice instead of white. The possibilities are endless!\n",
      "*   **Budget-Friendly:**  Cooking at home is almost always cheaper than eating out, and meal prepping helps prevent impulse buys.\n",
      "*   **Easy to Store:**  These bowls last for 3-4 days in the fridge, making them perfect for busy weeknights.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, ditch the takeout menus and give this Teriyaki Chicken Bowl recipe a try. Your body (and your wallet!) will thank you. Happy meal prepping!\n",
