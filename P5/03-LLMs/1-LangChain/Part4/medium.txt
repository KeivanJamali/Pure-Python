Education :
Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering   |   Sharif University of Technology
         29th October 2020 â€“ 21st June 2024   |   GPA : 4.0/4.0   |   Ranked 2 among 80
 High School Diploma in Mathematics and Physics  |  National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (Sampad)  
         Sep 2014 â€“ June 2020 
Projects :
Simplex-step   |   Feb 2024 â€“ June 2024
â€¢ Performing the Simplex algorithm â€“ the magic starts here
â€¢ Prepping the two-phase Simplex method â€“ making sure weâ€™re ready for anything.
â€¢ Implementing sensitivity analysis â€“ because knowing how changes affect our solutions is key.
â€¢ Using duality to optimize the performance â€“ duality is like finding the secret sauce for efficiency!
â€¢ The model base code can be tracked on KeivanJamali.com and GitHub.
Food Vision with PyTorch   |   Oct 2023 â€“ May 2024
â€¢ Currently engaged in the development of a vision-based model using PyTorch.
â€¢ Utilize transfer learning techniques to prepare the model of EfficientNetB2.
â€¢ The model deployed into Hugging-Face
â€¢ The model base code can be tracked on KeivanJamali.com and GitHub.
Clinic Online Website   |   Oct 2023 â€“  Jan 2024  |   Supervisor: Dr. Habibi
â€¢ Our team developed a clinic website using Python and Django. The platform streamlines clinic management by handling appointment scheduling, patient registration, and medical record management.
â€¢ Leveraging the Django framework, we created a user-friendly web application. Patients can easily book appointments and access their medical history, while administrators efficiently manage staff schedules and patient records.
â€¢ Our project involved defining tables, implementing classes with object-oriented programming (OOP) methods, and seamlessly integrating the back-end and front-end components using Django.
â€¢ The project can be tracked on KeivanJamali.com and GitHub.
LOS Prediction Under Rainy Weather Conditions with Machine Learning   |   Oct 2023 â€“  Jan 2024  |   Supervisor: Dr. Z. Amini
â€¢ Worked on LOS Prediction Under Rainy Weather Conditions with Machine Learning using Python.
â€¢ Developing a model to predict unseen regions.
â€¢ Planning to write a research paper on the projectâ€™s findings and insights.
â€¢ Progress and updates on the project can be tracked on KeivanJamali.com and GitHub.
Traffic Demand Modeling Using Neural Networks   |   Jun 2023 â€“ Jan 2024   |   Supervisor: Dr. Z. Amini
â€¢ Developed and implemented a traffic demand modeling framework using the Gravity model and Neural Networks for accurate flow prediction.
â€¢ Analyzed results from four OD matrices (SiouxFalls, Anaheim, Chicago, and Gold Coast Zones) to gain insights into traffic patterns.
â€¢ Contributing to a research paper on the findings.
â€¢ Documented the project details and outcomes on KeivanJamali.com & GitHub.
FEM Modeling of Azadi Tower   |   Feb 2023 â€“ June 2023   |   Supervisor: Dr. M. Ahmadi
â€¢ Developed a 2D FEM model to simulate and analyze the structural behavior of Azadi Tower.
â€¢ Provided valuable insights by analyzing displacements and forces of each node.
â€¢ Received the highest score in the class (2.5 out of 2).
â€¢ Project is available on KeivanJamali.com & GitHub.
Modeling the Transfer of Pollution in the Persian Gulf   |   Feb 2023 â€“ June 2023   |   Supervisor: Dr. Danesh
â€¢ Developed a comprehensive model to simulate pollution diffusion and advection in the Persian Gulf.
â€¢ Investigated the impact of primary pollutants and analyzed pollution transfer patterns.
â€¢ Created an animation illustrating the movement and spread of pollutants within the ocean.
â€¢ Project is available on KeivanJamali.com & GitHub.
