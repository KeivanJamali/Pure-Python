## Project Overview  

As part of our **Advanced Programming** course, my team and I set out to create a clinic website using **Python** and **Django**. The goal was to develop a seamless platform for clinic management, with features such as:  

- **Effortless appointment scheduling**  
- **Patient registration**  
- **Medical records management**  

We aimed to simplify the clinic's operations, making it easier for both patients and administrators to manage appointments, access health records, and track schedules.  

With **Django** as the foundation, we crafted a **user-friendly** interface, allowing patients to book appointments with ease and revisit their medical histories. For the clinic's staff, the website simplifies the management of appointments, schedules, and reports.

## Project Steps  

1. **Define Tables:**  
   - Set up the necessary database tables for patients, appointments, and medical records.  

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
   - Defined relevant classes and methods to handle data interaction.  

3. **Backend & Frontend Development with Django:**  
   - Worked on both backend logic (using Python and Django) and frontend design to ensure ease of use.
