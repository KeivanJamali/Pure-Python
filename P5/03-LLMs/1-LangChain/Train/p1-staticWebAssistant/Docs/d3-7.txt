## Project Overview  

In this project, the goal was to model the pollution movement in the **Persian Gulf**, simulating the effects of leakage into the ocean. The study includes the processes of **advection** (movement with ocean currents) and **diffusion** (spread of pollutants).

**Problem:**  
What is the speed and the time for the pollution to spread under the following conditions?  

1. **Only Diffusion**  
2. **Diffusion and Advection with Constant Speed**  
3. **Diffusion and Advection with Accelerating Speed**

---

## Project Steps  

1. **Code the Diffusion and Advection Processes:**  
   - Model the movement of pollution using both advection and diffusion equations.  

2. **Color Visualization:**  
   - Used millions of colors to better illustrate the changes in the ocean environment as pollution spreads.  

3. **Plot and Animation:**  
   - Created animations to help visualize the pollution spread and its impact over time.

## Results of the Project  

- Even small amounts of leakage can be extremely harmful to the environment.  
- The project features animations for all three scenarios, with the third scenario (diffusion and accelerating advection) shown below.  

**Scenario 3 - Animation:**  
*The animation shows how the pollution spreads with accelerating advection and diffusion.*

## Code Sources  

This modeling was done using **Python**.
