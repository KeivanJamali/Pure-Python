## A Glimpse into My World

Hey there! Iâ€™m Keivan Jamali, hailing from the timeless city of Yazd, Iran. Yazdâ€™s ancient vibes are my roots, and right now, Iâ€™m diving deep into the world of Civil Engineering at Sharif University â€“ yep, the top-notch place for engineering in Iran. Iâ€™ve got this thing for programming too, especially machine learning. Iâ€™m no Python wizard (yet!), but I get by, and Iâ€™ve dabbled in HTML and CSS for some design fun. This website? One of my brainchildren, crafted with a bit of WordPress magic.

## Chasing My Passion

Civil Engineering isnâ€™t just a career for me; itâ€™s a love affair. Researching in this field feels like a thrilling hobby. Iâ€™m always hungry for new knowledge and love figuring out how to solve real-world problems with it. Teamwork? Sign me up! I thrive when collaborating with others, striving towards shared dreams and goals.

## What I Do for Fun

When Iâ€™m not buried in books or coding away, youâ€™ll find me in the kitchen, whipping up new recipes. Cooking is my creative playground. Music, too, has a special place in my heart. I tinker with the piano and flute â€“ still an amateur, but itâ€™s all about the joy it brings. ðŸŽ¶
