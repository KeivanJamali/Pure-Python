# Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and Sustainability

---

## 1. What is ITS?

**Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)** is defined as:

> "The application of advanced information processing and communications, sensing, and control technologies to surface transportation."

### Objective
- Promote more efficient use of existing highway and transportation networks
- Increase safety and mobility
- Decrease environmental costs of travel

### Why ITS?
The current transport system is about as large as it will get, particularly in urban areas. To improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and increase safety, we must communicate more with drivers than passive road signs allow. **ITS aims to increase efficiency.**

## 2. Six Areas of ITS Activity

### Technology-Oriented Areas

| Area | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **ATMS** (Advanced Traffic Management Systems) | Monitor, control, and manage traffic flow | Centralized traffic control, message boards, priority routing for emergency vehicles, interactive traffic signals |
| **ATIS** (Advanced Traveler Information Systems) | Assist travelers in planning and improving travel efficiency | Onboard map displays, digital traffic data systems, trip planning services, route/headway info for transit |
| **AVCS** (Advanced Vehicle Control Systems) | Assist drivers in controlling vehicles through electronic/mechanical devices | Adaptive cruise control, night vision enhancement, lane departure warnings, collision avoidance systems |

### Application-Oriented Areas

| Area | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **APTS** (Advanced Public Transportation Systems) | Improve attractiveness and economics of public transit | Fleet monitoring, dispatching systems, real-time displays at stops, intelligent fare collection |
| **CVO** (Commercial Vehicle Operations) | Assist commercial vehicle operations | Weigh-in-motion systems, electronic placards, automatic vehicle location (GPS), toll collection |
| **ARTS** (Advanced Rural Transportation Systems) | Systems for rural areas with lower population densities | Route guidance, emergency signaling, incident detection, road warning systems |

## 3. ITS Objectives (Finnra's Prioritization)

| Priority | Objective | Weight |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Ensure efficiency of traffic and transport | 30% |
| 2 | Improve traffic safety | 30% |
| 3 | Manage demand more efficiently | 15% |
| 4 | Use infrastructure more efficiently | 15% |
| 5 | Improve cooperation between modes | 5% |
| 6 | Ensure mobility and accessibility | 5% |

### Top ITS Functions by Effectiveness
1. **Incident management** - Most accomplishable, especially for efficiency and safety
2. **Weather information systems** - Critical for safety
3. **Smart car technologies** - Modifying vehicle actions to avoid hazards
4. **Demand-responsive public transit** - Important for mobility/accessibility

## 4. ITS and Sustainable Transport

### The Sustainability Problem
Current transport systems are **non-sustainable** because they:
- Deplete finite petroleum reserves
- Pollute local and global environments
- Result in excessive human fatalities and injuries
- Encourage too much traffic congestion

### ITS Contributions to Sustainability

#### 🔋 Petroleum Conservation (Minor Impact)
- Navigation systems that avoid needless "searching" behavior
- Parking availability information systems
- Route-finding technologies
- *Overall impact is minor but real*

#### 🌍 Environmental Benefits (Minor Impact)
- Any ITS system that saves fuel also decreases:
  - Local air pollutants
  - Global greenhouse gases
- *ITS will help to some extent*

#### 🚗 Safety (MAJOR Impact - Primary Contribution)
This is the **main contribution of ITS to sustainable transport**:

| Technology | Benefit |
|------------|---------|
| Automatic restraint systems & airbags | Minimize injuries from crashes |
| Speed adaptation systems | Adjust vehicle speed to traffic conditions |
| Safe distance maintenance | Keep safe distance from other vehicles |
| Collision warning systems | Forewarn of potential collisions |
| Collision avoidance systems | Enable vehicle to avoid collisions automatically |
| Driver state monitoring | Wake drowsy drivers |
| Vision enhancement | Improve vision in bad weather/night conditions |
| Automatic speed enforcement | Prevent excessive speeding |
| Weather information services | Lead people to cancel trips in poor conditions |

#### 🚦 Congestion Reduction (Moderate Impact)
- Roadside/radio systems informing of congested situations
- Alternative route recommendations
- Crash detection with upstream driver notification
- **Congestion pricing/tolls**:
  - Variable pricing based on traffic flow
  - Electronic toll collection (transponders)
  - HOV lane credits

## 5. Real-World ITS Case Studies

### 1. San Diego Automated Highway (AVCS)
- 7.6-mile section of Interstate 15
- First demonstrated in August 1997
- Features:
  - Onboard cameras and sensors for lane-keeping
  - Under-bumper sensors tracking roadway magnets
  - Cost: Less than $10,000/mile (vs. $1-10 million for new highway)
- Benefits:
  - Eliminates 90% of crashes caused by human error
  - Predictable drive times
  - Less fuel consumption and pollution
  - Higher traffic densities with controlled vehicle spacing

### 2. SR-91 Express Lanes, Orange County (Congestion Pricing)
- Four express lanes in freeway median
- Variable toll ($0.25-$2.50 based on traffic flow)
- Transponder-based electronic charging
- 3+ passenger vehicles get credits back
- Built and operated by private company

### 3. FasTrak System, Interstate 15
- Similar to SR-91
- Uses median lanes, transponders, and variable tolls

### 4. Road Weather Information Systems (RWIS)
- 44 US states have RWIS systems (as of 1998)
- Colorado: 150 RWIS sites
- Features:
  - Pavement sensors (temperature, dew point, ice percentage)
  - Wind speed/direction, barometric pressure
  - Video cameras for verification
  - Automatic highway advisory radio activation
- Impact: Weather plays role in **two-thirds of all highway crashes**

### 5. In-Car Navigation Systems (ATIS)
- CD-ROM digital maps → Internet-updated systems
- Voice-directed navigation (e.g., Pioneer Raku-Navi)
- GPS-based location
- Anti-theft capability
- GIS integration for nearby facilities info
- Air bag deployment notification for emergency dispatch

## 6. Key Conclusions

### ITS Impact Ranking on Sustainability:

| Rank | Impact Area | Significance |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Motor vehicle fatalities and injuries reduction** | Greatest contribution |
| 2 | **Congestion reduction in corridors** | Second most important |
| 3 | **Efficiency improvements in transport operations** | Third priority |

### Critical Consideration
> "Every major transport improvement over the past 200 years ended up resulting in an increase in the total amount of travel taking place."

**Question**: Will ITS generate additional travel?

**Answer**: It may, but that travel should be:
- **Safer** than ever before
- **More efficient** than ever before

Therefore, negative impacts of additional travel may not be as great as they are now.
